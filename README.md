lexoffice - A typesafe API implementation for api.lexoffice.io
==============================================================

For API docs see [the official docs](https://developers.lexoffice.io/docs/#lexoffice-api-documentation)

How to support the development:

* Use it and report bugs or missing features! Ideally tell me what you're
  using it for.
* The docs are in a bad shape. Help me improve them!
* Tell the LexOffice Support that I need a staging environment to write
  integration tests. They don't answer me... :(
